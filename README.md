# Length converter - Pytest example

## Purpose
Example of parameterised tests in Python unit tests with Pytest.

The system under test is a `Length` class with the following specification:
- Constructor. It receives as parameters the length of the original value and its measure system (`I` - Imperial or `M` - Metric).
- `convert()`. It returns the conversion of the length value to the opposite measure system.

## Tools
Pytest / Python
